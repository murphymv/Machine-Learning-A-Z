# Introduction {.unnumbered}

This site combines all code scripts from the Udemy course [Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/) into a series of pages for easy navigation. Pages are compiled from R Markdown notebooks, one for each section of the course (i.e. parts 1--10). Python and R code chunks (and their output) are included together under each section.
